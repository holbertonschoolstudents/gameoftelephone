  /*
    To compose a feature, write the following:

    featureX;

    where X is a number with one or two digits, less than 21.

    You may write between 2 and 5 features. Each feature is written in a separate line, ending in a semi-colon.

    Example:

    feature1;
    feature3;
    feature18;

    Keep in mind, the company you work for has a set policy for conflict resolution.

    When two people push two sets of features, the resulting feature set must contain each feature that was coded, exactly once.

    As a final rule, all comments should be deleted when merging.

  //Feature set goes here. delete me.
